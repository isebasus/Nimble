# Nimble

## A client for brands and production companies to deal business easier.

Nimble is **really early in development** and I plan to make this into a e-commerce based app where production companies can create their own marketplace and sell the blanks (*blank t-shirts, hoodies, joggers, etc...*). This app will be able to
let individuals who own brands to upload their designs, add specifications, and track their production, while the production companies can manage their orders easier. Users can rate the production companies, see which companies are trending, 
and most importantly **find the best quality shit**. There is no other software that can make production easier for these companies so we will make tons of bank üí∞.

### üóíÔ∏è Bucket List
- Create a dashboard (very important)
- Spice up the design for the production profiles
- Add a payment system
- Add a sign up system
- Create statistics of who has the best quality stuff (merch, turnaround times, and general ratings)
- Add a dynamic "customize page" system
- Make this app beautiful, dynamic, and epic (nice designs ofc)
